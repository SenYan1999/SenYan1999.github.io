### about me

I'm currently a Ph.D candidate of Information Systems in the Division of Organizational Leadership and Information Analytics, [Leeds School of Business](https://www.colorado.edu/business/), [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/). Prior joining my Ph.D program, I received my Bachelor from [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/). 

My research adopts the computational design science approach in Information Systems to develop AI-based systems for construct validity assessment and theory development. I also apply the most advanced AI methods including large language models, multimodal deep learning, and graph neural networks, together with domain expertise to build intelligent artifacts for knowledge discovery and socially impactful applications such as AI-generated content detection.
